# Differential Gene Expression of RNA-Seq

Workflow for differential gene expression of RNA-Seq data. The data used in this script is from samples of **normal, 1 day post evisceration (1DPE) and 3 day post evisceration (3DPE)** of the intestine of the sea cucumber _Holothuria glaberrima_. Tissue and RNA extraction was done by **David Quispe (2019)**.
