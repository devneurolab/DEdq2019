# Differential Gene Expression of RNA-Seq

Here you are going to be able to find and follow the script for the workflow for differential gene expression of RNA-Seq data. The data used in this script is from samples of:

- normal
- 1 day post evisceration (1DPE) 
- 3 day post evisceration (3DPE)

of the intestine of the sea cucumber _Holothuria glaberrima_. 

Tissue and RNA extraction was done by **David Quispe (2019)**.

You can access both the [html](DESeq_dq2019.html) and [Rmd](DESeq_dq2019.Rmd) document.
